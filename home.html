    <h2>Having a Pet Conure</h2>

      <p>
        Green cheek conures are small, beautiful and very intelligent birds with vibrant personalities. If well taken care
        of, these parrots can live for up to 30 years and can grow to be around 25 centimetres in length.
        Their feathers consist of many different colours; green cheek conures are mostly dark green with a
        dark red tail. They also usually have small patches of red, yellow, blue, and different shades of grey all over their
        body.<br><br>
        Even though they are small, green cheek conures are very expressive and tend to have large personalities.
        They are bold, adventurous and outgoing. Green cheek conures love to socialize and have fun,
        which is part of why they make such fantastic pets. Along with being very personable,
        these parrots are also extremely smart. With some practice they can learn to say simple words
        and phrases, and can even learn fun tricks and commands.<br><br>
