    <h2>Components of a Perfect Cage

      <img class="rightImage" src="cage1.jpg" alt="Green cheek conure and appropriate sized cage.">

    </h2>

      <h3>Size and Shape</h3>

        <p>
          A good size for your conure's cage would be no less than 45 centimetres square. <br>
          You want to ensure that your conure is comfortable - it should be able to fully <br>
          spread its wings and sit on a perch so that its tail is not touching the bars.<br><br>

          It is much more preferable if you are able to get a cage that is rectangular in <br>
          shape rather than circular. Rectangular cages make mounting perches easier, and <br>
          they allow for your conure to find comfort in a corner if it is feeling stressed.
        </p>

      <h3>Walls, Ceiling and Floor</h3>

        <p>
          The bars of your conure's cage should be 1/2 to 3/4 inches apart. A cage with inappropriate
          bar spacing could injure your bird - you do not want its head or toes to get stuck
          in between. Horizontal bars are preferred, as this makes it easier for your green
          cheek conure to climb the cage walls and move around.<br><br>

          Some parrots tend to feel uncomfortable if the ceiling of their cage is solid.
          It is better to get a cage with a barred ceiling to ensure your conure feels as happy
          as possible. Use newspaper or a bird-specific pet litter product to keep the floor
          of the cage clean.
        </p>

    <h2>Toys and Accessories</h2>

      <p>
        Green cheek conures can get bored easily, so its important that you have lots of toys on
        hand to keep them entertained. The best toys for your parrot are things that are colourful
        and shiny, that can also be safely chewed on.
